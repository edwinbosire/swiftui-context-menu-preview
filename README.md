# SwiftUI Context Menu with Preview

This repository demonstrates an experimental SwiftUI implementation of context menus with previews.  
It showcases how to leverage the `contextMenu` modifier in SwiftUI to present rich, interactive previews when users long-press or right-click on UI elements.

## Features

- **SwiftUI-based**: Pure SwiftUI experiment, no UIKit required.
- **Context Menus**: Easily attach context menus to views.
- **Preview Support**: Show previews alongside menu actions.
- **Customizable Actions**: Add, remove, or modify menu options as needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edwinbosire/swiftui-context-menu-preview.git
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**  
   Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.

3. **Run the Project**  
   Select a simulator or device and hit **Run**.

## Usage

Check out the sample views in the project for examples of how to use the `contextMenu` modifier with previews:

```swift
YourView()
    .contextMenu {
        Button("Action 1", action: { /* ... */ })
        Button("Action 2", action: { /* ... */ })
    } preview: {
        PreviewView()
    }
```
